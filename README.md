# CarND-Path-Planning-Project
Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree Program

### Reflection
In order to safely navigate a car around a highway track a combination of using Frenet coordinate transformations along with spline interoplation was used. Using Frenet coordinates is a really easy way to specify which lane the car should be in as well as how far down the road it should be. In Frenet the two coordinates are d,s where d is the distance from the center of the road which cooresponds to the lane the car is in, and s is simply the distance along the highway. 

The highway map waypoints are widely spaced so its Frenet outline is very jagged, consisting of line segments with sharp corners. The result of not using any interoplation and simplying relaying on the Frenet transformation with increasing s and constant d is that during the waypoint corner transistions the car experiences alot of acceleration, also the Frenet transformation isnt linear and has the greatest amount non-linearity at the corner cases which causes points to have unequal spacing. Using the spline from spline.h is greatly able to help smooth out the path planning path.

Instead of using the Frenet coordinates on tightly spaced points, only three widely spaced Frenet points are using with dynamic d based on the desired lane, and with s values spaced 30m [main.cpp at line 406]. This way the car's projected path is nice and smooth and doesnt experience any max acceleration or jerk values. Next was making sure the car could speed up and slow down at a constant acceleration that was less than 10 m/s^2, in order to do this the reference velocity was always incremented or decremented by some constant value that resulted in plus or minus 5 m/s^2 [main.cpp at line 456] . Inorder for the ego vehicle to travel at the reference velocity the spline needed to be split into evenly spaced points, where the car would transverse to each point every .02 seconds. To do this the three anchor points where converted to the local vehicle coordinate space where the math was easier to use, and then spline could be linearly approximated with its distance and then the number of spaces could be calculated [main.cpp at line 464]. 

If there wasnt any cars in front of the ego vehicle then the reference speed was 49.5 MPH, chosen so it was just slightly under the speed limit, otherwise the car would start slowing down and also try to see if it can change lanes. The sensor fusion data allowed the ego vehicle to see all the other traffic cars on the road, each traffic car's Frenet values were used to see if it was in the same lane as the car and then how close it was to the ego vehicle [main.cpp at line 324]. This logic using Frenet values was used both for detecting traffic car infront of the ego vehicle as well as seeing if a lane change was safe. If a lane change was safe the ego vehicle simply would change its lane and the spline interoplation would make the lane change smooth [main.cpp at line 342 and line 372]. 

The lane change logic was quite simple, if there was a car in front of the ego vehicle then it would see if it was safe to change to the left lane, if the left lane was not safe then it would try to change to the right lane. Some improvements could be made to this lane change algorithm by projecting further ahead and using a cost function to see if it really resulted in increased speed. Currently the car was able to go 4.32 miles around the highway without any incidents in 5:36. 
 
### Simulator.
You can download the Term3 Simulator which contains the Path Planning Project from the [releases tab (https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim/releases).

### Goals
In this project your goal is to safely navigate around a virtual highway with other traffic that is driving +-10 MPH of the 50 MPH speed limit. You will be provided the car's localization and sensor fusion data, there is also a sparse map list of waypoints around the highway. The car should try to go as close as possible to the 50 MPH speed limit, which means passing slower traffic when possible, note that other cars will try to change lanes too. The car should avoid hitting other cars at all cost as well as driving inside of the marked road lanes at all times, unless going from one lane to another. The car should be able to make one complete loop around the 6946m highway. Since the car is trying to go 50 MPH, it should take a little over 5 minutes to complete 1 loop. Also the car should not experience total acceleration over 10 m/s^2 and jerk that is greater than 50 m/s^3.

#### The map of the highway is in data/highway_map.txt
Each waypoint in the list contains  [x,y,s,dx,dy] values. x and y are the waypoint's map coordinate position, the s value is the distance along the road to get to that waypoint in meters, the dx and dy values define the unit normal vector pointing outward of the highway loop.

The highway's waypoints loop around so the frenet s value, distance along the road, goes from 0 to 6945.554.

## Basic Build Instructions

1. Clone this repo.
2. Make a build directory: `mkdir build && cd build`
3. Compile: `cmake .. && make`
4. Run it: `./path_planning`.

Here is the data provided from the Simulator to the C++ Program

#### Main car's localization Data (No Noise)

["x"] The car's x position in map coordinates

["y"] The car's y position in map coordinates

["s"] The car's s position in frenet coordinates

["d"] The car's d position in frenet coordinates

["yaw"] The car's yaw angle in the map

["speed"] The car's speed in MPH

#### Previous path data given to the Planner

//Note: Return the previous list but with processed points removed, can be a nice tool to show how far along
the path has processed since last time. 

["previous_path_x"] The previous list of x points previously given to the simulator

["previous_path_y"] The previous list of y points previously given to the simulator

#### Previous path's end s and d values 

["end_path_s"] The previous list's last point's frenet s value

["end_path_d"] The previous list's last point's frenet d value

#### Sensor Fusion Data, a list of all other car's attributes on the same side of the road. (No Noise)

["sensor_fusion"] A 2d vector of cars and then that car's [car's unique ID, car's x position in map coordinates, car's y position in map coordinates, car's x velocity in m/s, car's y velocity in m/s, car's s position in frenet coordinates, car's d position in frenet coordinates. 

## Details

1. The car uses a perfect controller and will visit every (x,y) point it recieves in the list every .02 seconds. The units for the (x,y) points are in meters and the spacing of the points determines the speed of the car. The vector going from a point to the next point in the list dictates the angle of the car. Acceleration both in the tangential and normal directions is measured along with the jerk, the rate of change of total Acceleration. The (x,y) point paths that the planner recieves should not have a total acceleration that goes over 10 m/s^2, also the jerk should not go over 50 m/s^3. (NOTE: As this is BETA, these requirements might change. Also currently jerk is over a .02 second interval, it would probably be better to average total acceleration over 1 second and measure jerk from that.

2. There will be some latency between the simulator running and the path planner returning a path, with optimized code usually its not very long maybe just 1-3 time steps. During this delay the simulator will continue using points that it was last given, because of this its a good idea to store the last points you have used so you can have a smooth transition. previous_path_x, and previous_path_y can be helpful for this transition since they show the last points given to the simulator controller with the processed points already removed. You would either return a path that extends this previous path or make sure to create a new path that has a smooth transition with this last path.

## Tips

A really helpful resource for doing this project and creating smooth trajectories was using http://kluge.in-chemnitz.de/opensource/spline/, the spline function is in a single hearder file is really easy to use.

keep it as simple and environment agnostic as possible. However, we recommend
using the following settings:

* indent using spaces
* set tab width to 2 spaces (keeps the matrices in source code aligned)

## Project Instructions and Rubric

Note: regardless of the changes you make, your project must be buildable using
cmake and make!


## Call for IDE Profiles Pull Requests

Help your fellow students!

We decided to create Makefiles with cmake to keep this project as platform
agnostic as possible. Similarly, we omitted IDE profiles in order to ensure
that students don't feel pressured to use one IDE or another.

However! I'd love to help people get up and running with their IDEs of choice.
If you've created a profile for an IDE that you think other students would
appreciate, we'd love to have you add the requisite profile files and
instructions to ide_profiles/. For example if you wanted to add a VS Code
profile, you'd add:

* /ide_profiles/vscode/.vscode
* /ide_profiles/vscode/README.md

The README should explain what the profile does, how to take advantage of it,
and how to install it.

Frankly, I've never been involved in a project with multiple IDE profiles
before. I believe the best way to handle this would be to keep them out of the
repo root to avoid clutter. My expectation is that most profiles will include
instructions to copy files to a new location to get picked up by the IDE, but
that's just a guess.

One last note here: regardless of the IDE used, every submitted project must
still be compilable with cmake and make./
